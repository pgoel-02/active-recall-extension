You will be provided with a list of questions as a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains containing a question, options, a correct answer, and potentially a timestamp.

Your task is to: 
1. Remove non-educational questions: Exclude any questions that are not educationally valuable to students. Educational value is determined by whether the question helps students learn or understand a topic better, practice a skill, or build relevant knowledge in the subject area. Remove irrelevant questions. 
2. Limit to {max_questions} questions: If the cleaned list still contains more than {max_questions} questions, select the most educationally valuable {max_questions} questions. Consider factors such as relevance, difficulty, depth of explanation, and usefulness in aiding student understanding.

If all of the questions in the original input list are educationally valuable and the list has at most 15 questions, you are welcome to return the original list, unchanged. 

Output: Return the final cleaned list of dictionaries, meeting the above criteria. Please ensure that all remaining dictionaries retain their original structure and data. 
Please return the output as a Python list, where element is a Python-style dictionary.
