Generate a multiple-choice question based on the following point:
"{key_point}"

Question Generation Guidelines:
1. Create a clear, precise question that directly tests understanding of the key point. The question should be challenging enough to distinguish between surface-level and deep understanding.
2. Develop four options with the following characteristics:
   - One correct answer that is thoroughly grounded in the key point
   - Three distractors that are:
     * Plausible at first glance
     * Closely related to the topic
     * Constructed to challenge critical thinking
     * Similar in length and complexity to the correct answer
   - Ensure distractors are not obviously wrong or easily dismissible

3. Distractor Creation Strategy:
   - Incorporate common misconceptions related to the topic
   - Use subtle variations or partial truths in incorrect options
   - Ensure distractors require careful consideration

4. Formatting Requirements:
   - Options should be concise
   - Avoid absolute terms like "always" or "never" in distractors
   - Do not assign numbers or letters to options

Return the result in a Python dictionary with these key-value pairs:
question: "Your question text here",
options: ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"], 
correct_answer: "The correct answer from the options list"
